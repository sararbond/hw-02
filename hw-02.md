## Load packages and data

library(tidyverse)
library(dsbox)
```

## Exercises

### Exercise 1

There are 13245 rows in the data set.

### Exercise 2

Each row represents an airbnb.

### Exercise 3

The wrap function made everything easier to read and less cramped given
the amount of neighborhoods.

``` r
ggplot(data = edibnb, mapping = aes(x = price)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 50) +
  facet_wrap(~neighbourhood)
```

    ## Warning: Removed 199 rows containing non-finite values (stat_bin).
